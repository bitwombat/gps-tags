# MongoDB to MySQL Migration Plan for GPS Device API

## Overview
This plan outlines the migration from MongoDB to MySQL for your GPS device API service, ensuring data preservation and improved query capabilities.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

### 1.1 Analyze Current MongoDB Data Structure
- Export sample MongoDB documents to understand the JSON structure
- Identify all fields being stored (location, battery voltage, timestamp, etc.)
- Determine data types and field variations across documents
- Note any nested objects or arrays that need flattening

### 1.2 Design MySQL Schema
- Create normalized tables based on JSON structure
- Design primary table for GPS data with columns for:
  - `id` (auto-increment primary key)
  - `device_id` (GPS device identifier)
  - `latitude` (DECIMAL for precision)
  - `longitude` (DECIMAL for precision)
  - `battery_voltage` (DECIMAL)
  - `timestamp` (DATETIME)
  - `raw_json` (JSON column for backup/reference)
  - Additional fields as needed
- Consider indexes for frequently queried fields (device_id, timestamp)

## Phase 2: Environment Setup

### 2.1 MySQL Database Setup
- Install MySQL server
- Create database and user with appropriate privileges
- Configure connection settings and performance parameters
- Set up backup strategy

### 2.2 Development Environment
- Set up local MySQL instance for testing
- Install MySQL Go driver (`go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`)
- Create database migration scripts

## Phase 3: Code Migration

### 3.1 Create New MySQL Data Layer
- Implement MySQL connection pool
- Create database models/structs for GPS data
- Implement CRUD operations for MySQL
- Add proper error handling and logging

### 3.2 Update API Endpoints
- Modify existing endpoints to use MySQL instead of MongoDB
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Add validation for incoming JSON data
- Implement JSON parsing to extract fields for MySQL storage

### 3.3 Configuration Updates
- Update configuration files for MySQL connection
- Add environment variables for database credentials
- Update Docker configurations if applicable

## Phase 4: Data Migration

### 4.1 Create Migration Tool
- Write Go program to:
  - Connect to both MongoDB and MySQL
  - Read MongoDB documents in batches
  - Parse JSON and extract fields
  - Insert data into MySQL tables
  - Handle errors and log progress

### 4.2 Migration Strategy
- **Full Migration**: Export all MongoDB data and import to MySQL
- **Incremental Migration**: Run migration in batches to avoid memory issues
- **Validation**: Compare record counts and sample data between databases

### 4.3 Migration Script Structure
```go
// Pseudo-code structure
func main() {
    // Connect to MongoDB and MySQL
    // Query MongoDB in batches
    // For each document:
    //   - Parse JSON
    //   - Extract fields
    //   - Insert into MySQL
    //   - Store original JSON in raw_json column
    // Log progress and handle errors
}
```

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

### 5.1 Unit Testing
- Test all new MySQL functions
- Verify JSON parsing accuracy
- Test error handling scenarios

### 5.2 Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints with real GPS device data
- Verify data integrity after migration
- Performance testing with expected load

### 5.3 Data Validation
- Compare sample records between MongoDB and MySQL
- Verify GPS coordinates precision
- Check timestamp accuracy and timezone handling

## Phase 6: Deployment

### 6.1 Staging Deployment
- Deploy new MySQL-based service to staging
- Run migration tool on staging data
- Perform end-to-end testing

### 6.2 Production Deployment
- **Option A - Blue/Green Deployment**:
  - Set up new MySQL service alongside MongoDB
  - Migrate data during low-traffic window
  - Switch traffic to new service
  - Keep MongoDB as backup temporarily

- **Option B - Gradual Migration**:
  - Implement dual-write to both databases
  - Gradually migrate read operations
  - Phase out MongoDB after validation

### 6.3 Monitoring and Rollback Plan
- Monitor MySQL performance and memory usage
- Keep MongoDB backup for quick rollback if needed
- Set up alerts for database errors or performance issues

## Phase 7: Post-Migration

### 7.1 Performance Optimization
- Analyze query performance
- Add indexes based on actual usage patterns
- Optimize database configuration

### 7.2 New Features
- Implement complex queries that were difficult in MongoDB
- Add reporting capabilities
- Consider adding data aggregation features

### 7.3 Cleanup
- Remove MongoDB dependencies from code
- Clean up old configuration files
- Update documentation

## Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Analyze MongoDB data structure
- [ ] Design MySQL schema
- [ ] Create migration tool
- [ ] Set up test environment
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests

### During Migration
- [ ] Backup MongoDB data
- [ ] Run migration tool
- [ ] Validate data integrity
- [ ] Test API functionality
- [ ] Monitor system performance

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Monitor MySQL performance
- [ ] Verify all features work correctly
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Train team on new system
- [ ] Plan MongoDB decommissioning

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: 1-2 weeks (Analysis and setup)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (Code migration)
- **Phase 4**: 1 week (Data migration tool)
- **Phase 5**: 1-2 weeks (Testing)
- **Phase 6**: 1 week (Deployment)
- **Phase 7**: 1 week (Post-migration)

**Total**: 7-10 weeks

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Maintain MongoDB backups during transition
- **Downtime**: Use blue/green deployment or dual-write strategy
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor and optimize MySQL configuration
- **Rollback**: Keep MongoDB service available for quick rollback

## Success Metrics
